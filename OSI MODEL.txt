OSI - Open system Interconnection
- used to define & understand how data is transferred from one computer to an another 

- introduced by ISO (1984) International standardize organization
consists of
1. Application
2. Presentation
3. Session
4. Transport
5. Network
6. Datalink
7. Physical

-Each layer is package of protocol

1. Application Layer
-used by network applications (browsers,outlook, skype etc) , uses protocol HTTP, HTTPs, NFS, FMTP, DHCP, SNMP, TELNET, POP, IRC, NNTP, etc)
-provides services like File transfer, Email, Web surfing, Virtual terminal

File transfer- uses FTP
Web surfing uses HTTP/HTTPs
Email  uses  SMTP- 
Virtual terminal uses TELNET

2. Presentation Layer
--Receies data from application layer, this data in the form of characters & numbers, presentaion layer converts this data into binary format ( machine understandable language)
E.g cnverting ASCII to EBCDIC code

a)Translation -conersion from characters & numbers into binary format
b)compression- Presentation layer reduces number of bits that are used to represents original data, can be lossy or Lossless
c) Encription- to maintain the integrity of data before transmission converts data into non readable format called as encryption
   Decryption- converts encrypted data into original format

-data sending through SSL

3. Session Layer
- uses API's 
-. NETBIOS- Network Basic Input Output System allows applications on different systems to communication between computers
-Just before session starts with the server, server performs a function called Authentification (process of verifying who you are)
- After authentification process is success Authorization is checked
- session layer keeps tack of file downloaded

4. Transport Layer
- controls  the reliability of communication through segmentation, Flow Control, Error Control
- in session layer data received from presentation layer is divided into small pieces called segments
- Each segment contains source,destination, port & sequence number
- port number helps to direct each segment to the correct application
- Sequence number helps to reassemble segments in correct order to form correct message at receiver
- Flow control- controls amount of data being transmitted
- Transport layer also helps in error control-if transmitted data is not received/missing at destination transport layer enables Automatic Repeat Request to retransmit the missing data/corrucpted data
- A group of bits called checksum is added into each segments to findout received data is corrupted or missing
- Uses TCP, UDP
- Provides services like connection oriented Transmission, connectionless transmission
	connection oriented Transmission -uses TCP
	connectionless transmission uses UDP
UDP is faster than TCP because UDP does not provide acknowledgment whether data is received or not
UDP is used where streaming video, Email transmission etc
TCP is used for WWW, FTP etc
- Transport layer passes data to the Network layer as segments

5. Network Layer
- Works for the transmission of data from transport layer from one cne computer to another
- Data units in the network layer are called as Packets

	Functions
	a) Logical Addressing (IP addressing is done, IPv4, IPv6)
	2. Routing
	3. Path determination
- Every computer in the network has its own unique IP address
- Network layer assigns source & destination address to each segment to form a packet

Routing is process of moving data packets from source to destination

IP Format
255.255.255.21
whhere first 3 255 represents Network and 21 represents address of host

Path determination- suppose computer is connected to a network with many possible paths, network layer finds best path to send data

6. Datalink Layer
- Receives packets from network layer
Types of addressing
	1. Logical addressing - done by Network Layer
	2. Physical addressing - done by data link layer

- MAC address is added into data packets
MAC address in 12 digit numeric number embedded into NIC
- Data in data link layer is called Frame
- Frames will send from one NIC to an another NIC via local media such as copper wire, optical cable or Air

Functions
- Allows upper layer of OSI model to access media using technique called as Framing
- Controlls how data is placed & received from the media using techniques called Media Access Control & Error detection

CSMA

7. Physical Layer
Physical layer is the only layer of OSI network model which actually deals with the physical connectivity of two 
different stations. This layer defines the hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies, pulses used to represent
binary signals etc. Physical layer provides its services to Data-link layer
